=========================

adds you the ability to migrate a sqlite(3) file to mysql

simply edit $filename, $host, $user, $pass and $dbname to match your needs and call "php -f index.php" with php in your path and index.php in your current working directory

you can also have the index.php in the document root of you webserver (though not recommended as others could - accidently or not - execute the script) and use it from there on
